# 4061. Minimum Queen Moves to Reach Target

**Difficulty:** Easy  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-queen-moves-to-reach-target/)

---

There is an `8 x 8` empty chessboard with **1-indexed** rows and columns.

You are given an array `source = [sr, sc]` representing the starting position of a **queen**, and an array `target = [tr, tc]` representing the target position.

In one move, the queen travels one or more squares along a single **row**, **column**, or **diagonal**, staying within the board.

Return the **minimum** number of moves for the queen to land **exactly** on `target`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** source = [8,1], target = [1,8]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

A single diagonal move takes the queen straight from `(8, 1)` to `(1, 8)`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** source = [4,2], target = [1,3]

**Output:** 2

The queen moves from `(4, 2)` to `(4, 3)`, then from `(4, 3)` to `(1, 3)`, reaching the target in 2 moves.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** source = [1,1], target = [1,1]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

The queen is already at the target position, so no moves are needed.

**Constraints:**​​​​​​​

- `source == [sr, sc]`
- `target == [tr, tc]`
- `1 <= sr, sc, tr, tc <= 8`
